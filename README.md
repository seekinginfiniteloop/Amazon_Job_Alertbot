# Amazon Job Alertbot

![Amazon Job Alertbot](amazon_alertbot_sm.png "Amazon Job Alertbot")


Amazon Jobs Alertbot is an AWS-powered job alert agent that scrapes amazon.jobs with your search criteria and emails you updates... because Amazon apparently doesn't want you to be able to get updates the easy way.


## okay okay... this project is dead, but it is mostly functional; all I had left was the web interface for generating search jsons

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Amazon Job Alertbot

Amazon Job Alertbot was born over a weekend (probably more like 6 hours collectively...) out of a simple frustration -- unlike *every other jobs site on earth* -- Amazon jobs doesn't allow you to set up an update agent. It's clearly a deliberate choice, for reasons I can't discern. 

Because I enjoy irony, I designed Amazon Jobs Alertbot for easy deployment as a CloudFormation stack of AWS lambda function/step function microservices: DynamoDB to store jobs, Systems Manager's ParamStore to store configurations, CloudWatch Events to trigger the function at a time of your choosing, and Simple Email Service to send you emails with new jobs matching your criteria, and of course CloudWatch for logging. All wrapped up with an automatic deployment script. Just in case someone at Amazon thought adding jobs alerts would be too hard; I wanted to make it easy for them if they changed their mind.

It started as a simple lambda function but then I got sucked into an exploratory rabbit hole of orchestrating a rube goldbergian microservice deployment to handle the task. Completely impractical, but I learned a lot along the way (biggest lesson: just use the cdk if you can program... debugging CloudFormation templates is very challenging, but does teach you a lot about how the cdk works under the hood). I didn't really design it to scale, but some simple changes would fix that (changing how the database stores data, using more distributed processes in the state machine -- I experimented with them but didn't want the costs associated since I'm just experimenting).

Of course, you can also easily modify the scripts to run locally, or on an instance of your choice.
